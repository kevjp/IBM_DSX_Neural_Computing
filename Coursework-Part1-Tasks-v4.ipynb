We will go through the whole process from loading preprocessing to training and testing classifiers in a distributed way in Spark. We wil use the techniques shown in the lextures and labs. I will also introduce here a few additional elements, such as the NLTK and some of the preprocessing and machine learning functions that come with Spark. You are not expected to need anything beyond the material handed out so far and in some cases the Spark documentation, to which I have put links in this document.  \n\nThe structure is similar to the lab sheets. I provide a code structure with gaps that you are supposed to file. In addition you should run 2 small experiments and comment on the results. The lines where you are supposed to add code or take another action are marked with \">>>\" \nplease leave the \">>>\" in the text, comment out that line, and write your own code in the next line using a copy of that line as a starting point.\n\nI have added numerous comments in text cells and the code cells to guid you through the program. Please read them carefully and ask if anything is unclear. \n\nOnce you have completed the tasks, don't delete the outpus, but downlaod the notebook (outputs will be included) and upload it into the coursework submission area on Moodle. The coursework part counts for 25% or the total coursework.",

Similar to experiment 1 LR demonstrated the highest accuracy followed by NB followed by SVM across the 4 text types (raw text vs raw text minus stop words vs lemmatised text vs lemmatised text with stop words removed).\n# The function of lemmatising words and removing stop words is to distill the text into functional units that can be uniformly counted across different documents. \n# Removing stop words or lemmatising the text did not improve predictive accuracy of the LR model but combining the removal of stop words with lemmatising the text did result in a small increase in accuracy in test data.\n# In contrast reducing information in the text by removing stop words and lemmatising decreased the predictive accuracy of the NB model. \n# Interestingly it appears that stop words and lemmatising make separate and distinct contributions to the NB model whereby combining the removal of stop words with lemmatising the text resulted in a lower predictive accuracy compared with removing stop words or lemmatising on its own.\n# This possibly suggests that the added variance in the data by keeping stop words and not lemmatising helps to ensure the prior probability distribution of a document's classification (i.e. spam/other) more closely represents that of the document population.\n# This ensures that the NB model generates more accurate posterior probability estimates (better prediction accuracy) on the test data.\n# Similar to experiment 1 the SVM model showed no marked change in performance across the different text types. \n# As in experiment 1 the SVM model employed in this experiemnts uses a linear kernal which is unable to model the non-linear hyperplane that best separates the data into spam and other emails.\n# Hence using different text types did not change the predictive accuracy of the SVM model.\n# Further investigation revealed that the SVM model did not predict any of the emails were spam and simply labelled all emails as not spam. See spam and not spam count output in task 6.\n# Therefore the value of 83% identified by the SVM model relates to the proportion of emails that are not spam in the test set. \n# This aligns with the known ratio of not spam to spam emails in the ling spam data set which is reported to equate to 83.4% not spam : 16.6% spam (Androutsopoulos et al. 2000).\n\n# Reference \n# Androutsopoulos, I., Koutsias, J., Chandrinos K.V., Paliouras G., Spyropoulos C.D., An Evaluation of Naive Bayesian Anti-Spam Filtering.
